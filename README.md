# Dance Dance Revolution Game 🎶  

This is an interactive rhythm game developed in **Python** for Carnegie Mellon University’s *15-112 Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science* course.  
It simulates the classic *Dance Dance Revolution* gameplay, using beat detection and animation to create a responsive, rhythm-based experience.  

## 🕹️ Key Features
- **Beat Detection System:** Automatically identifies musical beats to sync arrows with rhythm.  
- **Dynamic Graphics:** Implemented with `tkinter` and the CMU Graphics library for real-time visual feedback.  
- **Performance Scoring:** Tracks player accuracy and combo streaks to adjust difficulty dynamically.  
- **Data Persistence:** Stores user scores in a local database for long-term tracking and replayability.  

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** `tkinter`, `random`, `time`, `math`, `cmu_112_graphics`  
- **Files:**  
  - `EXO-Revo.py` – main game engine  
  - `beatLst.py` – beat synchronization logic  
  - `Design Proposal.pdf` – project design document  
  - `demo-video.txt` – gameplay demo reference
